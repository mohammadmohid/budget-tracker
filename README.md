# 👋 Introduction
**Budge It** is a Personal Finance Tracking Web App, I am building to solve problems I face a lot. Now, I know the world didn't need another "budget tracking" app; but this still has some features which **students** will especially love (I know because I am one).

## 📝 Features
- Google Drive integration - so I don't have to manage storage locally nor pay for any cloud storage (thank god)
- Easy Instant Access - Using OAuth 2.0 with Firebase, anyone can login in just a *snap*.
- Insights and Suggestions (very less AI slop, so don't worry 😅).
- And did I mention the **easy pleasing and very clutter-free UI**

## 💻 Tech Stack
MERN stack with **Google Drive** and **Firebase Authentication** integration. 
**MongoDB** used only for storing account information rest is all handled by user's Google account so no access to any information other than what Google provides

### ❗ Note: The frontend is hosted on Vercel, whereas the backend is temporarily hosted on Render; since paying for cloud services and hosting is not on my list at the moment. Maybe in the future 😉
